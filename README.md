This is the third project out of a series in the [16 Frontend Projects](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) by Matt Studdert. It has really helped me in strengthening my CSS and design skills. Where I have to use my judgement when it comes to `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This is helping me train my eyes to perceive differences in spacings, sizes, colours and fontography.

Once built it will be deployed utilising Vercel



##### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
